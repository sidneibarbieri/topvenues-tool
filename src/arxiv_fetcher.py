"""arXiv harvester for the early-signal study.

Pulls preprints from a set of arXiv categories and persists them locally,
so the matching stage can run offline against a stable snapshot.

Per arXiv's API Terms of Use we acknowledge the data source via
:data:`ARXIV_ACKNOWLEDGMENT`; the study report prints it in its footer.

Operational notes drawn from the arXiv API User's Manual:
  * ``submittedDate`` is GMT and the response's ``<published>`` field is
    the v1 (original) submission date — exactly the anchor we need for lag.
  * A single query is capped at 30 000 results and must be paged in
    slices of at most 2 000; year-windowing keeps each query well under
    the cap (see :func:`year_windows`).
  * Results only change when new articles are added (~daily), so caching
    the JSONL snapshot and reusing it is both correct and encouraged.

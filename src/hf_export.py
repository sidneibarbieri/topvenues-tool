# TopVenues Cybersecurity Corpus

A reproducible, cybersecurity-focused bibliographic corpus for literature
reviews: {total:,} papers ({year_min}–{year_max}) across {n_events}
security and security-relevant venues, with {n_abstracts:,} abstracts and a BibTeX entry for
every record.

- **Code / tool:** <https://github.com/sidneibarbieri/topvenues-tool>
- **Pinned source of truth:** the gzipped SQLite snapshot shipped with the
  tool; this dataset is a faithful Parquet export of the same named snapshot.

## Release identity

{release_identity}

## Usage

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

corpus = load_dataset("{repo_id}", split="train")

security = corpus.filter(lambda paper: paper["area"] == "security")
```

## Interface evidence

[![Abstract-text search with populated previews](assets/topvenues-abstract-search.png)](assets/topvenues-abstract-search.pdf)

The capture applies the local interface's **Abstract contains** filter to
`intrusion detection` in `security-20`. Every displayed row has an abstract
preview. Open the [high-resolution PDF](assets/topvenues-abstract-search.pdf)
for close inspection.

## Scope and curation

The corpus is deliberately cybersecurity-only: 17 security venues plus 3
survey venues that anchor security literature reviews. Keeping the scope
focused (rather than mixing in off-topic AI, systems, or networking venues)
is what keeps abstract coverage high. The {security_total:,}-paper security
core carries {security_abstracts:,} abstracts ({security_pct:.1f}% coverage);
the remaining gaps are structural (e.g. Springer-hosted ESORICS and
publisher-gated recent proceedings) and are reported, not hidden. Records
without an abstract stay searchable by title, venue, year, author, and DBLP
key.

## Schema

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `paper_id` | Stable identifier (DBLP-derived) |
| `key` | DBLP key |
| `title` | Paper title |
| `authors` | Author list as a single string |
| `event` | Canonical venue name (normalized) |
| `venue` | Venue string as recorded by DBLP |
| `area` | Research area (`security`, `ai`, `networks`, `mobile`, `systems`, `cross-area`) |
| `year` | Publication year |
| `paper_type` | Record type (article, proceedings, …) |
| `pages` | Page range |
| `url` / `ee` | DBLP URL / electronic edition (DOI or publisher link) |
| `abstract` | Abstract, where the curation policy backfills it |
| `bibtex` | DBLP-canonical BibTeX entry |

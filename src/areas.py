"""Map each venue to a research area, for area-level analytics over the corpus.

Deterministic: a venue belongs to exactly one area, keyed on the canonical event
name stored in ``papers.event``. Journals and surveys that span areas are
``cross-area``. Extend ``AREA_BY_EVENT`` when a venue is added; an unmapped venue
reports ``unknown`` so coverage gaps stay visible instead of being silently bucketed.

"""Area-level analytics over the corpus: trends, prominent authors, award standouts.

Built on the deterministic venue-to-area registry (``areas.py``). Authors are parsed
from the stored author string; an author's per-area counts reflect the venues they
publish in. These functions support literature-review work: which areas are growing,
who the prominent authors are, and which papers were recognized with awards.

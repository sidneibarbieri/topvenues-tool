# Changelog

## 1.10.0 — 2026-09-21

- Apply the TopVenues visual identity to the interface: logo and favicon from
  the brand masters in `docs/brand/`, brand tokens in the stylesheet and the
  Streamlit theme. Chart colours are data colours, kept apart from the brand
  accent, and multi-series lines differ by dash as well as hue so that no chart
  relies on colour alone.
- Add `docs/PAPERS.md`, which binds each published paper to its repository,
  release, snapshot, SHA-256 and reproduction command, and route readers to the
  right artifact from both READMEs.
- Add the landing-page source under `site/`; it reads every figure about the
  current release from the profile manifest at build time.
- `CITATION.cff` declares the current version and cites the tools-track paper,
  with the main-track paper as a reference; a test keeps its version in step.
- The container image ships `docs/brand/`, which the interface now loads.

## 1.9.3 — 2026-09-02

- Move the one-command reproduction to the top of the README, before anything
  else a reviewer reads.

## 1.9.2 — 2026-09-01

- The minimal test tells the reader to activate the virtual environment, without
  which the first command failed on a clean machine. Memory and disk
  requirements are measured values.

## 1.9.1 — 2026-08-31

- Continuous integration also reproduces the profile the paper cites, in all
  eight environments, and publishes the execution record as an artifact.

## 1.9.0 — 2026-08-31

- Validate the container image by running it: the Evidence page no longer
  rendered inside it. Database identity is the file content, not its size and
  modification time.

## 1.8.1 — 2026-08-31

- Screenshot gallery and demonstration at the top of the README; version
  history.

## 1.8.0 — 2026-08-31

- Reproduce the paper's Table 2 by command (`reproduce_paper_table2.py`); each
  reproduction writes an execution record with environment, hashes and results.

## 1.7.1 — 2026-08-31

- Each claim declares the snapshot it was measured on, so a different profile is
  reported as out of scope instead of failing. Document Windows troubleshooting.

## 1.7.0 — 2026-08-31

- Reorganize the documentation on the CTA minimal template and describe the
  execution environment. `verify_paper_claims.py` binds every numeric claim of
  the paper to the query that verifies it. Fix the `Dockerfile`, which copied a
  missing path and installed unpinned versions.

## 1.6.0 — 2026-08-25

- New 7:49 demonstration video at 1920×1080, cut to the narration, with
  Brazilian Portuguese and English captions.

## 1.5.9 — 2026-08-25

- The arXiv search button passed API syntax to the web form and returned nothing
  for every author.

## 1.5.8 — 2026-08-25

- Derive the height of horizontal charts from the number of bars, removing empty
  frames.

## 1.5.7 — 2026-08-25

- Fix the scale of *Papers by class*: a bar starts at zero and a log scale has
  no zero, so no bar was drawn. Escape typed text before it becomes a `LIKE`
  pattern.

## 1.5.6 — 2026-08-25

- Describe the snapshots the package actually ships.

## 1.5.5 — 2026-08-25

- The interface also starts with `streamlit run web/app.py`. One headline-card
  row across pages.

## 1.5.4 — 2026-08-25

- Refuse to ship without the snapshots that published papers name.

## 1.5.3 — 2026-08-25

- The smoke test checks that the interface renders, not only that the port
  answers.

## 1.5.2 — 2026-08-24

- State the reproduction command for the reader's platform.

## 1.5.1 — 2026-08-24

- Restore the USENIX extractor fix and the top-4 concentration metric.

## 1.5.0 — 2026-08-24

- Publish `security-20-v4`, repairing ten titles truncated at inline DBLP markup
  without changing the 14,859-record denominator or any abstract text.
- Complete and publish a deterministic 200-record human abstract audit: 169
  records satisfy completeness, contamination, and paper-identity criteria
  (84.5%; 95% Wilson interval 78.8%–88.9%).
- Add exact audit-transfer evidence from v3 to v4 and retain the append-only
  provenance log rather than rewriting superseded events.
- Standardize researcher-facing `top-4` terminology, remove internal release
  counters from ordinary search screens, and improve chart semantics,
  readability, and record-level drill-down.
- Document and package a seven-minute end-to-end demonstration with US-English
  narration and English and Brazilian Portuguese captions.

## 1.4.0 — 2026-08-24

- Add researcher trajectories, direct collaboration evidence, and a transparent
  recent-versus-prior publication-rate signal with supporting-record drill-down.
- Add portable watchlists that preserve known paper IDs, successor-profile delta
  evaluation, and optional arXiv name-match candidate retrieval.
- Add a deterministic 200-record, venue-stratified v3 manual-audit instrument,
  upload validation, and Wilson interval summarizer without inventing labels.
- Keep only the current snapshot in the default package; historical binaries
  remain immutable in their original release tags and can be fetched with SHA-256
  verification.
- Correct DBLP numeric-suffix handling in external arXiv searches and replace the
  generic trajectory chart with a controlled editorial chart.

## 1.3.0 — 2026-08-24

- Publish `security-20-v3`, preserving prior snapshots while enforcing the
  declared 2019–2026 window and merging two DOI aliases confirmed by Crossref.
- Record all six same-metadata identity decisions in a versioned adjudication
  log; four pairs remain distinct because publisher resources remain distinct.
- Add Researcher Radar rankings by raw paper count (default) and by the
  separately labeled venue-tier heuristic, each with any/first/last-author views.
- Reproduce with a cross-platform, hash-locked dependency set on Python
  3.11–3.14.

## 1.2.1 — 2026-08-24

- Keep display preferences outside the semantic search-filter reset, removing
  a redundant Streamlit session-state assignment and its runtime warning.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-08-24

- Make declared venue tiers first-class in web search, author analytics,
  topic trends, CLI search, and exports.
- Preserve chronological order in annual charts and add selectable,
  consistently styled volume and share views.
- Reset stale search state before insight drill-downs and expose the active
  tier scope and tier evidence in result tables and author shortlists.
- Mark partial publication years to prevent incomplete-year trend claims.
- Install and health-check the web interface in the Linux/macOS and native
  Windows reviewer workflows.
- Test the artifact on Linux and Windows with Python 3.11 through 3.14 and
  refuse in-place overwrite of an immutable successor snapshot.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-08-24

- Publish `security-20-v2`, a successor snapshot that merges only records
  sharing an exact canonical DOI or landing page; the frozen `security-20`
  profile used by the SBSeg-SF paper remains available unchanged.
- Make the identity policy executable and testable, preserving distinct works
  that merely have similar titles.
- Add all-author, first-author, and last-author views to tier-aware author
  visibility.
- Add explicit insight-to-search navigation for venue and year distributions.
- Remove the stale, hard-coded test count from the web interface.

## 1.0.1 — 2026-08-18

- Add a native Windows PowerShell reproduction workflow.
- Close every core SQLite connection deterministically before temporary-file cleanup.
- Validate the reviewer workflow on Windows and Linux with Python 3.11 and 3.12 in CI.
- Align release identity, test counts, and platform instructions across reviewer documentation.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-07-25

- Publish the immutable `security-20` corpus profile and initial reviewer workflow.

# Published papers and the artifacts that reproduce them

The software evolves. The evidence behind a published paper does not.

Each paper below is bound to one repository, one release, one corpus snapshot
and one SHA-256. Its numbers are reproduced from that snapshot, never from
whatever the current release happens to ship. The corpora differ in size
because they are different, declared populations; none of them supersedes the
evidence of another.

> **About the DOIs.** SBC assigned both DOIs in the proceedings metadata, but as
> of September 2026 they are not yet registered with Crossref, so `doi.org` does
> not resolve them. The SOL links below are the working ones.

## Paper B — tools track, SBSeg 2026

**TopVenues: An Executable Corpus and Research Tool for Cybersecurity
Literature Reviews.** Sidnei Barbieri, Ágney Lopes Roth Ferraz, Lourenço Alves
Pereira Júnior. *Anais Estendidos do XXVI Simpósio Brasileiro de Cibersegurança
(SBSeg 2026) — Salão de Ferramentas*, pp. 234–241.

| Release | `sbseg2026-sf-submission-r1` |

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sidneibarbieri/topvenues-tool
cd topvenues-tool
bash reproduce.sh --profile security-20
```

Reproduces: 20,305 records and 17,491 abstracts (86.1%), every record with a
BibTeX entry, the six numeric claims of the paper, and its Table 2 row by row.
This profile ships on `main` because the paper prints that command against a
bare clone.

## The current release

Not a paper. The corpus TopVenues ships today, maintained and extended.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Repository | [`sidneibarbieri/topvenues-tool`](https://github.com/sidneibarbieri/topvenues-tool) |
| Profile | `security-20-v4` · 14,859 records · 20 venues · 2019–2026 |
| SHA-256 (`papers.db.gz`) | `bcb762c1c9b1f8ce6f075a8c1a23d68310caec853b0cc8ce3f42931e43c370c5` |
| Parquet export | [Hugging Face `sidneibarbieri/topvenues`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sidneibarbieri/topvenues) |

`security-20-v4` is a successor of `security-20`, not a correction of Paper B:
exact-resource deduplication and a declared 2019–2026 window make it a
different population, with its own identity.

## One repository

TopVenues moved to [`topVenues`](https://github.com/sidneibarbieri/topVenues)
in v1.11.0. This repository is archived with its history and tags, so the
command Paper B prints keeps working. Paper A is frozen at the
`sbseg2026-camera-ready` release of `topVenues`, whose continuous integration
re-runs it on every change, next to the `security-20` and `security-20-v4`
profiles. The current
version of this registry is
[`topVenues/docs/PAPERS.md`](https://github.com/sidneibarbieri/topVenues/blob/main/docs/PAPERS.md).

"""Cross-registry consistency for the venue vocabulary.

The normalizer, the area map, and the tier map are deliberately decoupled modules,
but they share one implicit contract: every canonical name the normalizer can emit
must be classifiable by *both* the area registry and the tier registry. A venue added
to one module but not the others would silently report ``unknown`` downstream. These
tests make that contract executable so the gap surfaces at test time, not in a table.
